Fizzbuzz Game
=====
This is a simple program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three the program prints "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five we print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five the program prints "FizzBuzz".

Objectives and Learning Achievements
=====

- pair coding: I worked with David Halewood and we finished this task extremely quickly together. It was fun to start pair coding.

- TDD: The task was an opportunity to introduce Test driven development, a software programming practice that increases code quality and program design. This is an important requirement throughout top software development companies.
